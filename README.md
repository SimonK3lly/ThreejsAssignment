# Three.js House Scene

This project is a 3D scene created using Three.js as part of a college assignment to practice and demonstrate skills in 3D web graphics.

## Project Description

The scene depicts a house with surrounding elements, including:

- A detailed house structure with textured walls and roof
- Windows and a front door
- A side wall with a gate
- Hedges around the property
- A ground plane with a texture
- A sky backdrop
- Animated birds

The project also includes interactive elements:

- First-person camera movement using WASD keys
- Camera rotation using arrow keys
- Clickable gate that triggers an animation sequence

## Key Features

1. **3D Modeling**: Custom geometry for house components
2. **Texture Mapping**: Applied to various objects for realism
3. **Lighting**: Directional and ambient lighting for scene illumination
4. **Camera Controls**: First-person movement and rotation
5. **Animation**: Birds flying in the sky
6. **Raycasting**: For object interaction (gate clicking)
7. **Dynamic Object Creation**: Birds and sphere generation



## Technologies Used

- Three.js
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Tween.js

## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have a local server set up (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser through the local server

## Controls

- W, A, S, D: Move the camera
- Arrow keys: Rotate the camera
- Click on the gate to trigger animations

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive elements
- Implement day/night cycle
- Enhance performance for mobile devices
